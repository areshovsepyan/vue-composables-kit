## 🧠 Why Use This?

These composables follow Vue 3 best practices, work seamlessly with the Composition API, and are easy to integrate. Perfect for Vue developers who want to:

- Speed up project setup
- Avoid rewriting common logic
- Build modular, testable code

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone or fork this repo and use any composable like so:

```ts
import { useClipboard } from '@/composables/useClipboard'

const { copy, isSupported } = useClipboard()
copy('Hello world!')
```

> Note: This kit assumes you’re using Vue 3 with <script setup> and TypeScript.

## 🧪 Try It Locally

You can test the included composables in a local development environment using the built-in playground app.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/areshovsepyan/vue-composables-kit.git

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash

### 3. Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
